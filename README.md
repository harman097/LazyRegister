# LazyRegister

This is a basic cash register management app. It lets you
count various currencies by value, count, or weight (for
coins with known, reliable weights) and sums the total.
You can also add rules specifying the ideal state for a 
new drawer, and the ideal deposit and drawer cleaning
method will be proposed to you.  It currently supports 
20 different currencies and custom cash drawer layouts 
to mimic your real life drawer.

I currently have no plans to continue with it.  While I
hope someone finds it useful, my main source of motivation
in making it was to gain a solid understanding of Android
fundamentals.

There is a very raw custom view used within that could be
useful in other projects - a Multi-State Toggle Slider - 
however it would need some fine tuning before I'd consider 
it ready for general purpose use.
